<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## How to Use

### Instructions

* Once you enter the app, you'll be greeted by the Menu. In there you'll see which functions (of those that appear on-screen) are currently active, what will be next, and what will probably take a bit longer.

* You can then press the correspondent number, and enter to proceed. Once the task is complete, you'll be returning to this menu.

#### Santa-fe events by date

* Here the app will scrape through Santa-Fe's city website and will get events with start time and location of a given specific date. If no event is found, nothing will be shown. If an invalid date is entered, you'll be returning to the menu.
* After date format is shown, you'll be expected to enter a date with said format.
